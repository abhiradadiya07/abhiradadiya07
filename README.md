# Hi 👋 My name is Abhishek Radadiya

## Software developer

As a passionate Software developer, I have been on a coding journey for the last three years, starting with the C language. My learning curve became exponential as I progressed through frontend development, Java, and Python during my university years. I then delved into networking and operating systems, which significantly enhanced my understanding of web development. I have developed proficiency in Node.js, React.js, and data structures and algorithms (DSA) in C++. Additionally, I am currently learning high-level design (HLD), low-level design (LLD), and system design principles. My experience includes developing websites for clients and handling deployments with AWS (S3, EC2) and Docker services. Always eager to learn and explore new technologies, I thrive in dynamic environments where innovation and growth are encouraged.
